## 🧮 BMR Calibration & Compensation Math

The app learns your real metabolism over time by comparing predicted vs actual weight changes. Here's how it works:

### Step 1: Base BMR (Mifflin-St Jeor Equation)

```
Male:   BMR = 10 × weight(kg) + 6.25 × height(cm) − 5 × age + 5
Female: BMR = 10 × weight(kg) + 6.25 × height(cm) − 5 × age − 161
```

### Step 2: Effective BMR

The Mifflin-St Jeor equation is a population average — your actual metabolism may differ. The app applies a learned `calibrationFactor` (default 1.0):

```
Effective BMR = BMR × calibrationFactor
```

All calorie burn calculations use `Effective BMR` instead of raw `BMR`.

### Step 3: Daily Weight Impact

Each day's weight impact is calculated from net calories:

```
netCalories = caloriesEaten − effectiveBmrBurned − exerciseCalories
dailyImpact = netCalories / 7700    (kg)
```

> **7,700 kcal ≈ 1 kg of body fat** is the energy density constant used for weight ↔ calorie conversion.

For today (partial day), BMR burn is proportional to time elapsed:

```
bmrBurnedSoFar = effectiveBmr × (hoursElapsed / 24)
```

### Step 4: Weight Prediction

Predicted weight accumulates daily impacts since the last manual weight update:

```
predictedWeight = lastRecordedWeight + Σ(dailyImpact)
```

Days with no logged meals/exercise are skipped (assumed net zero — the user simply forgot to log).

### Step 5: Calibration on Weight Update

When the user manually updates their weight (e.g., stepping on a scale), the app compares prediction vs reality:

```
actualChange    = newWeight − previousWeight
predictedChange = Σ(dailyImpact)  over the period
predictionError = predictedChange − actualChange
```

**Interpreting the error:**
- `predictionError > 0` → We overpredicted weight gain → real BMR is **higher** than estimated → factor should **increase**
- `predictionError < 0` → We underpredicted weight gain → real BMR is **lower** than estimated → factor should **decrease**

**Deriving the BMR correction ratio:**

The only tunable variable in the weight prediction is the BMR. If the *true* BMR were `r` times our current estimate, the extra calories burned would shift the prediction. For the corrected prediction to match reality:

```
predictedChange − [totalBmrBurned × (r − 1) / 7700] = actualChange
```

Solving for `r`:

```
totalBmrBurned × (r − 1) / 7700 = predictedChange − actualChange
r − 1 = (predictedChange − actualChange) × 7700 / totalBmrBurned
r = 1 + (predictionError × 7700) / totalBmrBurned
```

Where `totalBmrBurned` is the sum of effective BMR burned across all logged days in the period. Since `Effective BMR = BMR × factor`, the factor itself is multiplied by `r`:

```
thisMeasurementFactor = oldFactor × bmrCorrectionRatio
```

**Four safety guards prevent wild swings:**

1. **Same-day gate (dayGap = 0):** If the gap since last weight update is < 24 hours, skip calibration entirely. Short-term weight fluctuations (water, food in stomach) would poison the calibration. The weight is saved for display and BMR recalculation, but `lastWeightUpdate` and `calibrationBaseWeight` are NOT moved — the gap keeps accumulating until it crosses 24h.

   ```
   gapHours = (now − lastWeightUpdate) / 3600000
   dayGap = floor(gapHours / 24)
   if dayGap === 0 → save weight, skip calibration, keep baseline
   ```

2. **Noise filter (5% threshold):** If `|bmrCorrectionRatio − 1| ≤ 0.05`, skip calibration. Small errors are likely measurement noise, not metabolism changes.

3. **Clamping [0.5, 1.5]:** The factor is clamped so effective BMR never deviates more than ±50% from the Mifflin-St Jeor baseline.

4. **Duration-aware exponential smoothing:** Longer measurement periods produce more reliable signals. The smoothing ratio scales with `dayGap`:

   | dayGap | oldRatio | newRatio | Reasoning |
   |--------|----------|----------|-----------|
   | 0 | — | — | Skip calibration entirely |
   | 1 | 0.9 | 0.1 | 1 day is still noisy |
   | 2 | 0.8 | 0.2 | Moderate confidence |
   | 3 | 0.7 | 0.3 | Good signal |
   | 4 | 0.6 | 0.4 | Strong signal |
   | ≥5 | 0.5 | 0.5 | Max trust (capped) |

   Formula:
   ```
   newRatio = min(dayGap × 0.1, 0.5)
   oldRatio = 1 − newRatio
   newFactor = oldRatio × oldFactor + newRatio × clampedFactor
   ```

   **`calibrationBaseWeight`:** The `actualChange` for calibration is always computed against `calibrationBaseWeight` (not the display weight). This field is only updated when `dayGap ≥ 1`, ensuring same-day weigh-ins don't shift the calibration baseline.

### Step 6: Historical Impact Correction

After calibration, the app retroactively corrects the impact history for the period between weight updates. The prediction error is distributed evenly across all logged days:

```
correctionPerDay = predictionError / numberOfLoggedDays
correctedImpact[day] = originalImpact[day] − correctionPerDay
```

This ensures the impact history chart reflects what actually happened (based on the scale reading), not just what was predicted.

### Worked Example

> **Setup:** Male, 80 kg, 175 cm, 30 years old. `calibrationFactor = 1.0`.
>
> ```
> BMR = 10(80) + 6.25(175) − 5(30) + 5 = 800 + 1093.75 − 150 + 5 = 1749 kcal
> Effective BMR = 1749 × 1.0 = 1749 kcal
> ```
>
> **Over 7 days**, the user eats 1600 kcal/day, burns 100 kcal/day exercise:
>
> ```
> Daily net = 1600 − 1749 − 100 = −249 kcal
> Daily impact = −249 / 7700 = −0.0323 kg/day
> Predicted change = 7 × (−0.0323) = −0.226 kg
> Predicted weight = 80 − 0.226 = 79.774 kg
> Total BMR burned = 7 × 1749 = 12,243 kcal
> ```
>
> **User steps on scale:** actual weight = 79.5 kg
>
> ```
> actualChange    = 79.5 − 80 = −0.500 kg
> predictedChange = −0.226 kg
> predictionError = −0.226 − (−0.500) = +0.274 kg  (overpredicted weight gain)
> ```
>
> The user lost more weight than predicted → real BMR is higher than 1749.
>
> ```
> bmrCorrectionRatio = 1 + (0.274 × 7700) / 12243 = 1 + 0.1723 = 1.172
> thisMeasurementFactor = 1.0 × 1.172 = 1.172
> ```
>
> Passes 5% threshold (17.2% > 5%) ✓. Within [0.5, 1.5] range ✓.
>
> Duration-aware smoothing: `dayGap = 7` → `newRatio = min(7 × 0.1, 0.5) = 0.5`, `oldRatio = 0.5`
>
> ```
> newFactor = 0.5 × 1.0 + 0.5 × 1.172 = 0.500 + 0.586 = 1.086
> New Effective BMR = 1749 × 1.086 = 1899 kcal
> ```
>
> **Historical correction:**
> ```
> correctionPerDay = 0.274 / 7 = 0.0391 kg
> Each day's impact reduced by 0.0391 kg
> New daily impact = −0.0323 − 0.0391 = −0.0714 kg/day
> Sum = 7 × (−0.0714) = −0.500 kg  ✓ (matches actual change)
> ```
